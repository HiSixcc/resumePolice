### **Step 1: First Impression & Initial Diagnosis**

1.  **Target Position Analysis**: Your experience and project background clearly point to a **Backend Engineer, AI Applications**, at a **Senior Engineer** level. Your recent project (crushon.ai) and tech stack (Go, Python, LLM, Clickhouse) are a strong match for the provided job description.

2.  **30-Second Verdict**: **Worth a deeper look, but with significant reservations.**

    *   **Core Reason**: Your tech stack and projects (especially the crushon.ai experience) are impressive and highly relevant to the JD, which is a huge plus. However, your extremely unstable career path in the last year (July 2023 - April 2024)—4 months at Qiyuan and only 5 months at 360—is a major red flag. It raises serious concerns about your professional stability and ability to integrate into a team. I need to dig deeper into your project details to determine if you can deliver enough value in a short period to offset the risk associated with this instability.

### **Step 2: In-depth Line-by-Line Audit & Mentorship**

#### **A. Holistic Audit**

[❌] **Career Narrative:**

-   ❓ **Critique:** Your career path after 2023 becomes chaotic and unconvincing. Structurally, you separate "Entrepreneurial Experience" and "Experience," which adds to the confusion. The progression from Kuaishou (Test) -> Xiaoice (Stable Development) -> Qiyuan (Brief) -> 360 (Brief) -> crushon.ai (Brief) seems very jumpy and opportunistic. Your explanation of "chasing trends" in the "Entrepreneurial Experience" section, while honest, comes across as too subjective and emotional in a resume, lacking maturity in business and career planning.
-   🤔 **Negative Impact (Analysis):** This will lead a hiring manager to several negative conclusions: 1) **Poor Stability**: You may not be able to commit to a team for the long term. 2) **Weak Planning**: Your career choices seem based on short-term "trends" rather than a well-thought-out personal growth plan. 3) **Questionable Resilience/Adaptability**: Frequent departures, especially with specific reasons cited for Qiyuan (unstable team) and crushon.ai (work intensity), might suggest you are demanding about your work environment.
-   💡 **Suggestion:**
    1.  **Consolidate Timeline**: Don't separate "Experience" and "Entrepreneurial Experience." Arrange all work history in a single, reverse-chronological order to create a clear timeline.
    2.  **Reframe the Narrative**: You need a more professional story to explain this period. For example, proactively and positively frame this experience in your personal summary: "After building a solid engineering foundation at Xiaoice, I strategically chose to join early-stage startups to gain in-depth experience building AIGC applications from scratch. In these fast-paced environments, I led the design and launch of multiple core systems within extremely short cycles, accumulating valuable experience in rapid productization and data-driven growth." This reframes "instability" as "high-intensity, high-density, results-oriented exploration."
    3.  **Downplay Reasons for Leaving**: Remove all subjective reasons for leaving (e.g., work intensity, team instability) from the resume. These topics should be discussed with more maturity during the interview, not written on paper.

[✅] **Keyword & Tech Stack Alignment:**

-   Your tech stack aligns exceptionally well with the JD. Go, Python, K8s, Microservices, and especially your experience with Clickhouse and LLMs, make you seem tailor-made for this role. This is your greatest strength.

[⚠️] **Consistency Check & Noise Filtering:**

-   ❓ **Critique:** In the "Skills" section, you mention `kratos (committer)`. This is a very strong highlight, but in your project descriptions, you only mention `go-zero` and fail to emphasize your contributions to or application of Kratos. Additionally, the term `sayt` is unclear. Is it a typo or a very niche tool? If it's a typo, it's a critical error.
-   🤔 **Negative Impact (Analysis):** A highlight that isn't highlighted is no highlight at all. Unclear terminology can cast doubt on your professionalism and attention to detail.
-   💡 **Suggestion:**
    1.  If your contribution to Kratos is real, you must feature it in your project experience or personal summary. For example: "Contributor to the Kratos framework, with a deep understanding of its design philosophy, applying its concepts to optimize service governance in projects..."
    2.  Please check and correct `sayt`. If it's a typo, fix it immediately. If it's a specific tool, write its full name or add a brief note.

#### **B. Section-by-Section Audit**

**[❌] Personal Info & Skills:**

-   ❓ **Critique:** The word "Expert" is very dangerous. For an engineer with 4 years of experience to claim they are an "Expert" in Go and Python, I would immediately ramp up the interview difficulty to low-level language details, GC principles, and concurrency model source code. Any failure to meet these expectations would be seen as "exaggeration."
-   🤔 **Negative Impact (Analysis):** Claiming "Expert" sets an extremely high bar. If your interview performance doesn't match this claim, it will severely damage your credibility.
-   💡 **Suggestion:** Change all instances of "Expert" to "Proficient" or "Advanced." Let your project experience demonstrate the depth of your skills, not adjectives. Group your skills by category, for example:
    *   **Programming Languages:** Go, Python
    *   **Frameworks & Libraries:** Gin, Go-Zero, Kratos (Committer), FastAPI
    *   **Cloud-Native & Microservices:** Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, gRPC, Dapr
    *   **...and so on**

**[❌] Work/Project Experience - Critical Problem Area**

> Your project experience descriptions share a core problem: **You stack technologies without showing thought; you list tasks without showing impact.** You describe "what you did," but you completely fail to answer "So what?"

---
**Project 1: crushon.ai: Group Chat**

-   ❓ **Critique:**
    1.  **Point 1 ("Implemented message tree based on DynamoDB"):** This is an implementation detail, not an achievement. Why DynamoDB? What are its pros and cons compared to other NoSQL databases (like MongoDB) for a message tree scenario? What key problem did your design solve?
    2.  **Point 2 ("Local Character Cache"):** "Accelerated access" is a result, but it's not specific enough. "So what?" -> How much faster? By what percentage did the P99 latency decrease? What benefit did this bring to the user experience or server costs?
    3.  **Points 3, 4, 5:** These are just task descriptions. Building prompts, implementing a rating feature, using Streamlit for a prototype—these are the daily tasks of an engineer. What was your unique value? What challenges did you face when building the prompts? How did the data from the rating feature feed back into model training (DPO/ORPO)?
-   🤔 **Negative Impact (Analysis):** I see an executor, not a thinker. I cannot assess your ability to make technical decisions, the depth of your design, or your understanding of the business.
-   💡 **Suggestion:** Rewrite using the STAR method.
    *   **Revised Example (for points 1 & 2):** "To support highly flexible multi-character conversations (e.g., message branching, backtracking), **I led the design and implementation of a message tree storage solution based on DynamoDB**, leveraging its single-table design capabilities and millisecond-level read/write performance to support complex, real-time conversation flows. **By introducing a local + distributed two-tier caching strategy**, the character context retrieval latency was reduced from 500ms to under 50ms, **significantly improving conversation generation speed and enhancing the user's first-response experience**."

---
**Project 2: crushon.ai: Data Warehouse**

-   ❓ **Critique:** This is the most promising part of your resume, but it's written like a "tool deployment checklist." "Deployed and used airflow/airbyte/Superset" is worthless; any junior engineer can do that by reading the docs. Your value lies in **why** you chose these tools and **how** you combined them to solve a problem.
-   🤔 **Negative Impact (Analysis):** You look like a "tool user," not a "system builder." I care about your architectural design skills and data governance thinking, not whether you know how to `helm install`.
-   💡 **Suggestion:** Focus on the "from 0 to 1" challenges and results.
    *   **Revised Example:** "To address the pain points of scattered data and intuition-based decision-making in the early-stage product, **I independently led the construction of the company's data warehouse system from the ground up**. Faced with TB-scale raw log data, **I led the technology selection process, ultimately choosing Clickhouse Cloud as the core OLAP engine** for its outstanding query performance to meet real-time analysis needs. **I designed and implemented a layered data architecture (ODS->DWD->DWS->ADS)** to unify data definitions. **Automated the scheduling of hundreds of daily ETL jobs with Airflow**, reducing data synchronization latency to the hourly level. The final result was the delivery of **15+ core business dashboards (covering user growth, payment conversion, etc.), supporting over 80% of the data-driven decision-making needs for the product and operations teams** and enabling data-informed iteration."

---
**Other Projects (Qiyuan World, Xiaoice):**

-   These projects suffer from the same issues. For example, the **"three-tier storage" at Qiyuan World**: why three tiers? What was the purpose and data flow of each tier? The **"sproto protocol" at Xiaoice**: how much bandwidth did it save compared to Protobuf/JSON? What cost savings or user experience improvements in weak network conditions did it bring? The **"MongoDB client SDK performance optimization" on the Xiaoice API platform**: this is a great highlight, but what was the result? How much did the API's P99 response time decrease after optimization?

---

### **Step 3: Strategic Revision Blueprint**

1.  **Impact Narrative Toolbox:**
    *   **Basic Formula (STAR):** You currently have a list of `T(Tasks)`. You need to complete the `S(Situation)`, `A(Action)`, and `R(Result)`.
        *   **Situation (S):** What business/technical challenge were you facing? (e.g., To improve user retention...)
        *   **Action (A):** What key actions did you take? (e.g., I designed and implemented the XX system...)
        *   **Result (R):** What quantifiable/perceptible results did this bring? (e.g., ...which increased the retention rate by 15%.)
    *   **Advanced Formula (Decision-Tradeoff):** This demonstrates your technical depth and sense of ownership.
        *   "To solve **[complex problem]**, we evaluated **[Solution A]** and **[Solution B]**. I advocated for **[Solution A]** because of **[key reason, e.g., cost, performance, scalability]** and designed **[accompanying measures]** to mitigate its **[potential risks]**, ultimately achieving **[strategic outcome]**."
    *   **Before & After Example (from your resume):**
        *   **Before:** "client and Gateway connect via websocket, implement Ack mechanism, to ensure message confirmation at the business layer"
        *   **After (using STAR):** "**(S)** To solve the problem of unreliable message delivery in weak mobile network conditions, **(A)** I designed and implemented a bidirectional ACK confirmation mechanism based on WebSocket, using application-layer heartbeats and message sequence numbers to ensure message ordering and guaranteed delivery. **(R)** After launch, the end-to-end message loss rate dropped from ~5% to below 0.01%, significantly improving the reliability of real-time communication."

2.  **Heuristic Questions to Uncover Hidden Highlights:**
    *   **About the crushon data warehouse:** Building it from scratch, what was your biggest challenge? Was it messy data sources? The performance/cost tradeoff during selection? Or persuading the team to adopt a data-driven culture?
    *   **About the group chat project:** How is the "20% increase in revenue" attributed to your work? Did a feature you developed directly drive payments, or did it indirectly boost user activity, which then led to conversions? Be prepared with a detailed answer.
    *   **About being a Kratos Committer:** Which module did you contribute code to, specifically? Was this contribution because you found a bug or proposed a new feature?
    *   **About technology selection:** What was the toughest but ultimately correct technical decision you made on a project? Why did you choose it at the time? Did you consider other alternatives?

3.  **Impact Thinking Training:**
    *   Your description "fully integrated prometheus and opentelemetry to ensure the healthy operation of the program" is an ineffective statement.
    *   You need to think like this: What was the state before? "Monitoring was ineffective, troubleshooting relied on digging through logs, with an average time of 2 hours." And after? "Achieved real-time alerting for key metrics of core services (QPS, Latency, Error Rate)." What value did this create? "The mean time to detect (MTTD) for incidents was reduced from 2 hours to 10 minutes, and the SLA improved from 99.5% to 99.9%." **That is impact.**

### **Step 5: Final Verdict & Action Items**

1.  **Overall Assessment**: The "before" resume is a mediocre "job description," filled with technology stacking and vague descriptions. Its chaotic career path, in particular, would deter most cautious hiring managers. The revised template transforms it into a persuasive "**achievement showcase**" that maximizes your strengths through a clear career narrative, quantified results, and deep technical thinking, while proactively managing the risks of your career path.

2.  **Core Risk Points**:
    *   **Job Stability**: This is your most critical weakness. The revised resume attempts to persuade hiring managers that "while you don't stay long, you deliver high value quickly and densely" by emphasizing your significant contributions during short tenures. You must be prepared to explain this period in the interview with a very mature, honest, and positive narrative.
    *   **Authenticity of Achievements**: The quantified metrics in the new resume are very impressive and, therefore, more likely to be scrutinized. You must ensure that every number and every percentage is backed by facts and that you can explain their context in detail.

3.  **Next Steps (Action List)**:
    *   **[Top Priority] ✅ Load Your Ammunition:** Immediately review your projects and fill in all the `[Placeholders]` in the revised resume template. This is the foundation of your interview success.
    *   **[Second Priority] 🎤 Prepare Your Story:** For your career jumps, prepare a 3-minute verbal story. Key points: acknowledge the exploration, emphasize what you learned, and express a desire for stable development in the future.
    *   **[Third Priority] 🛠️ Match the JD:** For the specific JD you provided, you can add another sentence to your professional summary: "I have a strong interest and practical experience in large model applications such as agent construction and workflow orchestration," to further improve the match.
    *   **[Long-term Advice] ✍️ Build a Habit:** Starting today, for every problem you solve at work, create a small document recording the "Problem Context -> Solution Exploration & Tradeoffs -> My Actions -> Final Results & Data -> Reflection & Learnings." This will be an invaluable asset for your future career growth.

You have excellent project experience and technical potential. Don't let a poor resume bury them. Good luck.
